==========================
Ushahidi Twitter Aggregator
==========================

There are three controller services:
- Twitter controller; a service that will connect to the twitter firehose and add tweets to a rotating file
- Parser controller; a crontab that should run often, that grabs the oldest rotated file and parses the tweets and creates a csv file for batch insert

This controller should yet be created:
- Insert controller; a crontab that should run often, that grabs the oldest csv file and performs a batch insert into the database.

==========================
Config
==========================
Set the tmp_directory configuration option in the module, to choose the directory where to store the temporary files. Make sure it's writable by the user running the process

Set the site_protocol in the application/config/config.php to '', instead of 'http'. For now the only way to get this to work. This
should change since it interferes with the website behavior
