Ushahidi Twitter Aggregator
By: Maarten van der Veen
Version 0.01
==========================
There are three controller services:
- Aggregator controller; a service that will connect to the twitter firehose and add tweets to a rotating file
- Parser controller; a crontab that should run often, that grabs the oldest rotated file and parses the tweets and creates a csv file for batch insert
- Dumper controller; a crontab that should run often, that grabs the oldest csv file and performs a batch insert into the database.

==========================
Config
==========================
Set the tmp_directory configuration option in the module, to choose the directory where to store the temporary files. Make sure it's writable by the user running the process

Set the site_protocol in the application/config/config.php to '', instead of 'http'. For now the only way to get this to work.

Make sure your database user has FILE_PRIV = yes, otherwise it cannot load batch csv files into the db

Set your twitter username and password through the admin settings page.

Update your database with the sql/update file
==========================
Running
==========================
To run the php crontab use:
cd to path/to/index.php
path/to/php.exe path/to/index.php twitter/index
path/to/php.exe path/to/index.php parser/index

==========================
Admin
==========================
The admin page can be accessed on http://path/to/admin/twitter/index, you have to be logged in as admin to access this page
Currently, with a normal twitter account, you will have 150 api calls each hour, so if you add new geonames or unknown users
to the admin, you are limited to this number per hour.

You can add 3 keywords, users and geo locations at a time. You will get all the tweets with EITHER of these.

Keywords: case sensitive keywords
Users: usernames, by using the twitter API the exact username will be matched to the ID, so use the correct name only
Locations: use the placename + countrycode, the geonames API will be used to get the proper GPS location. Don't use streetnames etc, it doesn't work.
